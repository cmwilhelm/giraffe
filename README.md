Genetic algorithm project simulating an animal's phenotypic response to
a changing environment.


In this simulation, "Giraffes" are provided two chromosomes defining lengths
of neck and leg segments.

They are scored for fitness against their environment,
which currently consists of a sole selection factor: ability to reach tree leaves.
Global tree height changes at randomized intervals.

The model uses fitness-weighted reproductive rules, mutation, and randomized inheritance
of parents' genes.
